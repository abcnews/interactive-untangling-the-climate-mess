Well, some of it is hard, but some of it we&#x27;re actually well positioned to do.</p><p class="_1HzXw">We have three magic ingredients - sun, wind and space - that make us “uniquely placed to capitalise on a zero carbon future”, according to the CSIRO.</p><p class="_1HzXw">So rather than watching our “sunburnt country” progress to “heatstroke”, we could do something we all love: get rich. We’re talking jobs and growth, baby.

The countries most ravaged by the elements will become Gulf State-style rich -- and if there’s one thing Australia’s good at, it’s being fucked by nature. </p><p class="_1HzXw">Forget 100% renewable energy - we should be <a class="_2f8qj FQVx7 _2tPjN _1QHxY" href="https://reneweconomy.com.au/australia-could-aim-for-700-per-cent-renewables-arena-boss-11594/" data-component="ContentLink">aiming for 700 per cent renewables</a>, according to the head of the government’s Australian Renewable Energy Agency, Darren Miller. We could export the surplus - much like we do with fossil fuels now.</p><p class="_1HzXw">See, as the world moves to zero emissions, it will be cheaper for many Asian countries to import renewable energy from Australia than produce their own, according to the International Energy Agency.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Enter, our first character in the cast of Climate Survivor: an epic undersea cable. Can a cable the height of our continent make it rain for Australia - figuratively and literally? Let’s find out.</p><p class="_1HzXw">For years, Australians have enjoyed a codependent relationship with Bali based on good waves, cheap beer, ugly singlets and lax driving laws, but our spiritual connection is about to become a physical one.</p><p class="_1HzXw">In 2026, a 3500km undersea cable will hook our power grid up to the Bali-Java grid. After that, Indonesian homes will turn their lights on with power from solar panels and wind turbines in our Pilbara region, which will be home to the largest renewable energy plant in the world (the $30 billion Asia Renewable Energy Hub calls itself “renewables, at oil and gas scale”).</p><p class="_1HzXw">Another epic cable will run from Darwin to Singapore so that the buzzing financial hub can source a <a class="_2f8qj FQVx7 _2tPjN _1QHxY" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-30/nt-sun-cables-australia-project-awarded-major-project-status/12506516" data-component="ContentLink">fifth of its power from a giant solar farm</a> in our dusty outback by 2027. The Sun Cable project is backed by mining magnate Andrew Forest and tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes, who insists that while it looks “batshit insane” it’s “very feasible”.</p><p class="_1HzXw">It’s no secret that the Northern Territory is struggling, as symbolised by its bankrupt government literally paying workers to move there. That’s largely because it’s relied on exporting gas which has brought a boom and bust cycle. But the great thing about renewable energy is it doesn’t run out. The Top End (and indeed many of our states) could export clean energy forever.</p><p class="_1HzXw"><em>But wait a minute, aren’t renewables going to raise my power bills?</em></p><p class="_1HzXw">You’d be forgiven for thinking this after Barnaby Joyce went on that rampage about people not being able to afford toast due to renewables. But is it actually true? No - just ask South Australians.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Making fun of Adelaide might be a national past-time, but South Australians have more to gloat about than posh accents and never being convicts. They’re the only people in Australia <a class="_2f8qj FQVx7 _2tPjN _1QHxY" href="https://www.aemc.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-12/SA%20fact%20pack%20-%202019%20Residential%20Electricity%20Price%20Trends.pdf" data-component="ContentLink">paying less for power</a> than they were a few years ago, thanks to wind power and the giant Tesla battery installed in 2018. Keep in mind that’s the first and only mega-battery in Australia, so it’s hardly going to be the cheapest. And now imagine what bills might look like if that battery was a fraction of the price, as it will be in 2030.</p><div id="inputradelaide" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><p class="_1HzXw">For you, Australia getting rich on renewables looks like your energy bill being reduced or even cancelled. Yes - cancelled. Imagine not having to feel guilty about running the AC 24 hours a day?</p><p class="_1HzXw">With renewables flattening power prices, we could eradicate the energy poverty that sees many families choosing between food on the table and not-getting-heatstroke, which is frankly absurd in the world’s eighth-richest country.</p><p class="_1HzXw">But it’s not just about households: the cost of power is crippling our industries. What could Australia produce with abundant, cheap energy? The possibilities are endless - and having our own energy supply and producing more products onshore would help protect us from global shocks like… you know… war with Iran, or Coronavirus 2.0 (and there will be one).</p><p class="_1HzXw"><em>But wait a minute, who’s going to build all these renewables in a country full of mining magnates?</em></p><p class="_1HzXw">It’s been cheaper to build renewables than coal or gas plants since 2018 - even when you add in battery storage. More Elon Musks are lining up to throw billions at Australian renewables, but there are a few key blockers. The first is that we have no national energy policy to give them certainty. And that matters because the government controls things like the grid - which needs major upgrades to make it renewables-friendly.</p><p class="_1HzXw">What’s more, our Renewable Energy Target was reached in 2019 and there’s no plan to increase it. That target forced power companies to source around 23% of electricity from renewables, which cost the government nothing but created a market for renewable projects. Already, investment in large-scale renewables has halved and 11,000 renewables jobs could be lost by 2022 unless the target is updated - that’s equivalent to losing all the workers who produce coal for domestic use... not what you want in a recession.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Instead, the Morrison Government wants to spend taxpayer dollars propping up the gas industry which is bleeding so much money it can’t find investors itself. (While “natural gas” sounds green, it’s a fossil fuel that emits shitloads of methane, which stays in the air at least 28 times longer than CO2. Remember, oil and coal are also “natural”, and so is cyanide.)</p><p class="_1HzXw">The crazy thing is, the Government doesn’t need to spend a whole bunch of your future pension to bring about the energy transition (although, you know, that’d help…) It just needs to spend less: less of the $29 billion a year it spends on fossil fuel subsidies, less of the millions and potentially billions on new gas projects that would blast our emissions targets to smithereens.</p><p class="_1HzXw">With policy certainty and grid upgrades, we could unlock an avalanche of renewable projects - because they’re, quite simply, the cheapest option.</p><div id="inputtoast" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><div id="inputzerocarbon" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><h3 class="_3mduI _2t6_4 _1deB8 jwLlj _19NQB _1GKnS _2o9MN _1-RZJ" data-component="Heading">Challenge two: Do something about the burping cows (10% emissions)</h3><p class="_1HzXw">If you suffer from Bolognese Guilt, you’ll want to stick around for this one.</p><p class="_1HzXw">We all know that cows are methane on legs, but what you may not know is that Big Meat has reduced emissions by almost 60 per cent since 2005.

Shit-eating Mediterranean dung beetles.</p><p class="_1HzXw">The beetles roll the poo into a ball then bury it underground to feed their larvae, who can eat their own bodyweight in dung every day. Can you imagine eating YOUR body weight every single day? (As for the parents, they just eat the dung juice, or as one scientists dubbed it, “dung slurpie”).</p><p class="_1HzXw">Dung beetles can move a shit-tonne of manure; one species can pull 1,141 times their own body weight, the equivalent of you pulling six double-decker buses full of people around. Oh, and they’re the only animal that can navigate by the Milky Way.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Dragging poo through soil is like adding a fertiliser, turning humble paddocks into carbon sinks that can soak carbon dioxide out of the air like trees do.</p><p class="_1HzXw">So, while in modern times dung beetles have been sneered at for their predilection for eating faeces, they may yet have the last laugh. It seems the countless prehistoric peoples that worshipped them knew what was up, most famously the Egyptians, whose sun God was a human-dung-beetle hybrid, as rolling the sun around in a ball and then burying it was the only logical answer for where it went at night.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Even Christ himself was described by early Christian scholars as a dung beetle: “the good scarab has rolled himself in our filth”. So…. you could say Doug’s army of poo-tunnelers are doing the Lord’s work.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Back in the lab, researchers are working on vaccines to make cows less gassy (sadly there’s no equivalent for humans, but we’ll take a Covid vaccine as consolation prize).

The good news: we can solve this.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Despite our Prime Minister invoking utepocalypse last election, electric cars are on the way... as is an electric ute. And no, they’re not going to “steal the weekend”.</p><p class="_1HzXw">So you might’ve zoned out at the words “electric car”, but if you’re a driver, you’ll want to read this: if we lag behind on enabling you to go electric with your next car like the rest of the world, you’ll be lumped with the costs and difficulty sourcing parts that you’d have running a vintage mustang now.</p><p class="_1HzXw">It might be hard to imagine, but the types of cars we buy can shift very quickly. Just ask Holden and Ford - once the most popular cars on the road, the sedans that dominated the national imagination are now a rare sight on the roads.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Even if you don’t give a shit about the environment (in which case good on you for getting this far), there’s a strong case for going electric. We import 90% of our fuel from the Middle East with no stockpile on our own soil to fall back on in a crisis. Imagine if those billions were going to community-owned renewables in our regions instead? Plus, electric cars are silent and won’t choke our cities with toxic pollution, which is always handy.</p><p class="_1HzXw">And this really sums up something bigger: we’ve been sold the idea that climate action will lower our standard of living. But these machines of the future are actually a technological upgrade. As renewables journalist Bridie Schmidt put it, “imagine saying ‘no thanks, we’ll stick with the horse and cart.’”</p><p class="_1HzXw">Quieter, healthier cities with cheaper costs - does that sound like utepocalypse to you?</p><p class="_1HzXw"><em>That’s all well and good but I can’t afford to drop 60K on a Tesla, thanks anyway.</em></p><p class="_1HzXw">Electric car sales tripled in the past two years and even just doing nothing, they’re likely to become as cheap as other cars with half the operating costs midway through this decade. Half of new cars are bought by businesses and government - if they were incentivised to choose electric, it would rapidly bring down prices and offer cheap, second-hand EVs in a few years.</p><p class="_1HzXw">NSW is already transitioning its entire fleet of buses to electric, following cities like Shenzhen in China that have pulled it off. Australia Post is electrifying all its delivery vehicles, while the first electric garbage truck hit the streets in - you guessed it - Adelaide (even their trash is posh).</p><p class="_1HzXw">And if you still believe EVs are just for latte-sippers, have a chat with a miner - they’ve been using electric vehicles for a decade, because nobody wants to breathe a lungful of diesel underground.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Meanwhile in Japan, EV batteries are already being recycled to power street lights and convenience store fridges.</p><p class="_1HzXw"><em>But wait - electric cars take a lot of power. Isn’t that going to blow our emissions out?</em></p><p class="_1HzXw">Electric vehicles must be powered by renewable energy to be zero emissions. But more EVs means more renewables. To explain how, let’s meet the next character in our Climate Survivor cast: the “virtual power plant”.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Electric vehicles are essentially batteries on wheels. So your EV could act as a “solar sponge”, soaking up cheap excess solar that’s flooding the grid during the day and using it to power your home at night (or selling it back into the grid when power’s most in demand - kaching!)</p><p class="_1HzXw">For example, California company Enel X remotely controls 6000 electric vehicles parked across the state, directing them to store and then resell enough power for 120,000 AC systems.</p><p class="_1HzXw">So while you’re hard at work in the office, over in the carpark, your car’s busy being a virtual power plant controlled by a hivemind. This is the closest cars have come to saving the world since Transformers.</p><p class="_1HzXw">The AEMC and the South Australian Liberal government reckon this approach could be a game-changer for power prices. We “gold plate” poles and wires to manage the few hours a day when everyone wants to use power at the same time. But if you can run your dishwasher with power your car bought earlier, that reduces “peak demand”, so power companies can spend less on that turbo infrastructure and pass the savings on.</p><div id="inputcarscansaveus" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><p class="_1HzXw"><em>I hear what you’re saying but I just can’t see myself driving an electric car.</em></p><p class="_1HzXw">If you’re still hung up on the idea of refilling at a bowser and not a power point, don’t despair - you might like a hydrogen car. At the moment there are very few hydrogen vehicles in production, but that&#x27;s about to change, driven by countries like Japan who don’t have the renewables to service EVs. On our own soil, a startup called H2X hopes to begin producing hydrogen cars from Port Kembla near Wollongong in 2022.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Our abundant supplies of hydrogen (more on that later) could bring Aussie car-making back from the grave, making it more than a faint memory for your uncle who still mutters “Ford… Holden…” in his sleep.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Hydrogen will be key for trucks and other long-haul transport, where recharging every 200km is a drag.</p><p class="_1HzXw">There’s also biofuels, which are made by burning organic waste, which is a win-win. Right now, we are missing out on thousands of regional jobs by overlooking bioenergy, according to KPMG. It’s a huge part of Europe’s energy mix - used for heating, cooling, fuels and chemicals.</p><p class="_1HzXw">The fuels of the future are imminent. But really, we don’t need trucks travelling distances so epic that drivers must abuse amphetamines to get their paycheck. We need high-speed rail, powered by renewable energy - like Deutsche Bahn, the fabled German network and trainspotters’ wet dream, which is already 57% renewable and will be fully renewable by 2038. High-speed rail would knock out up to 80% of plane trips along the corridors it serves too.</p><p class="_1HzXw">And without spending a dollar, we could do so much more today. We’re one of the worst countries in the OECD at regulating vehicle emissions - which is like giving car-makers a free pass to pollute. Instead, we could follow New Zealand and tax new high-polluting cars to subsidise cleaner cars. Or we could use congestion charging, like London, where it costs more to travel at peak hour, helping to spread out commuting and ease pollution.</p><p class="_1HzXw">We could also let office-workers choose to keep working from home, and never have to wear pants again.</p><div id="inputfossiltransport" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><h3 class="_3mduI _2t6_4 _1deB8 jwLlj _19NQB _1GKnS _2o9MN _1-RZJ" data-component="Heading">Challenge four: Wean our industries off carbon (40% emissions)</h3><p class="_1HzXw">Let’s start with the good news. Switching to clean energy and fuels (which we already solved) would knock out up to 60 per cent of emissions across most sectors of the economy.</p><p class="_1HzXw">The first step is to electrify everything that runs on gas. But while the Australian Industry Group is <a class="_2f8qj FQVx7 _2tPjN _1QHxY" href="https://cdn.aigroup.com.au/Submissions/Budget/2020/Budget_submission_2020-21.pdf" data-component="ContentLink">calling for subsidies</a> to do just that, ScoMo’s Covid-19 commission, stacked with gas executives, wants to ramp up gas production. </p><p class="_1HzXw">This means taxpayers will foot the bill for a whole lot of gas that no-one wants to buy, or factories will put off electrification and emissions will continue to climb.</p><p class="_1HzXw">While we’re not on track, electrifying everything is relatively simple. What’s harder is tackling “non-energy emissions”, like fugitive emissions. While that sounds very Harry Houdini, it’s basically the gases that escape when you’re pulling fossil fuels out of the ground and shipping them around the world. It’s hard to completely contain an invisible gas, although some nifty solutions are being developed, like a <a class="_2f8qj FQVx7 _2tPjN _1QHxY" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/climate/methane-monitoring-satellite.html" data-component="ContentLink">satellite</a> that can spot leaking gas wells from space.</p><p class="_1HzXw">But here’s the thing: as the world moves to net zero, fossil fuels will make up less of our export mix. And that’s not the catastrophe you might be expecting: for example, while we’re the world’s biggest gas exporter, most of the profits go offshore anyway, most of the companies pay no tax here and the industry employs fewer Australians than just about any other per dollar of investment.</p><p class="_1HzXw">The reality is, most Australians don’t wear a hard hat to work - service industries make up 70 per cent of our GDP, employing four out of five Australians. </p><p class="_1HzXw">Still, we can’t afford to lose any jobs in regional Australia, which is why we need to get our skates on when it comes to replacing fossil fuels exports. </p><p class="_1HzXw">Fortunately, there’s a bunch of opportunities here. Aside from sending renewable energy to Asia through epic submarine cables, we can use it to create zero-emissions products and fuels, which will be in high demand as the world moves to net zero.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Already, the EU is proposing a tax on carbon-intensive products - that’s the world’s largest market, so it’s likely to force companies to work out how to reduce emissions throughout their supply chains.</p><p class="_1HzXw">With our abundant renewable energy, we are well placed to be the world’s factory for zero-emissions products. If you thought “Made in Australia” died with Dick Smith’s Y2K-era Ozemite, think again.</p><p class="_1HzXw">So what are we selling exactly? Well, a few things, but let’s start with our next character in the Climate Survivor cast: green hydrogen.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Hydrogen - the element most famous for its role as H2 in H20 - will be the oil and gas of the 21st century.</p><p class="_1HzXw">You can make fuel from it (remember hydrogen cars?), you can power things, heat things - you name it, hydrogen can do it.</p><p class="_1HzXw">“Grey” hydrogen is made with fossil fuels, but “green” hydrogen is made from wind and solar energy instead, making it a zero emissions fuel.</p><p class="_1HzXw">The more clean energy you have, the more cheaply you can produce green hydrogen, so Chief Scientist Alan Finkel is figuring out how we become a hydrogen superpower.</p><p class="_1HzXw">It’s possible that we won’t be able to compete with other renewable-rich countries after shipping because we’re an island at the end of the Earth. But it’s ok - we can still use our green hydrogen to make zero-emissions chemicals and metals like steel, aluminium, iron ore and ammonia. </p><p class="_1HzXw">The <a class="_2f8qj FQVx7 _2tPjN _1QHxY" href="https://grattan.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2020-06-Start-with-steel.pdf" data-component="ContentLink">largest and most economically viable</a> opportunity is green steel-making, according to the Grattan Institute. Coal-based steel is responsible for 6-7 per cent of global emissions, but swapping for green steel could sustainably build the developing world while growing our steel industry in places like Whyalla, Newcastle and XX.</p><p class="_1HzXw">We could also export biofuels, which would grow our agricultural sector and pump money into the regions.<br/>And let’s not forget, shipping things to other countries isn’t the only way to get rich. Education and tourism are some of our top exports, and have ironically been held back over the years by the high Aussie dollar that resulted from the mining boom. </p><p class="_1HzXw">Technology, the arts and the night-time economy are all sectors we could grow (once going to a bar involves more dancing, fewer QR codes).</p><p class="_1HzXw"><em>Ok so what about materials that just can’t be greened?</em></p><p class="_1HzXw">We’ll need to swap for greener alternatives, or recycle existing materials.</p><p class="_1HzXw">An example of swapping is constructing high-rise buildings from timber. While that might sound very kum-ba-yah, the notorious hippies at Lendlease just opened the world’s tallest timber office building in Brisbane, <a class="_2f8qj FQVx7 _2tPjN _1QHxY" href="https://www.lendlease.com/au/media-centre/media-releases/20181122-lendlease-unveils-australias-tallest-timber/" data-component="ContentLink">25 King</a>. (Can jet fuel melt timber beams? Hopefully we won’t find out).</p><p class="_1HzXw">Often, the substitutes are actually better - for example, geopolymer cement is a greener type of concrete that’s twice as fire resistant. You can check it out for yourself at Brisbane Airport (just kidding, you’re not coming anywhere near Fortress Queensland).</p><p class="_1HzXw">Where we can’t swap, we’ll reuse existing materials over and over to create a “circular economy”. </p><p class="_1HzXw">For example, some Melbourne councils are turning printer cartridges into asphalt (and if you still own a printer, you’ll know refilling it is like feeding a tamagotchi - endless, thankless and <a class="_2f8qj FQVx7 _2tPjN _1QHxY" href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/feb/23/printer-ink-cartridges-paying-more-getting-less" data-component="ContentLink">essentially a con</a>.) Once again, the printer-cartridge superhighway actually outperforms a regular road. It’s better able to handle trucks, with a “65 per cent improvement in fatigue life” (yes, even roads feel tired all the time for no reason).</p><p class="_1HzXw">Printer cartridges would otherwise be sitting in landfill until the year 2500, along with every coffee cup you’ve ever thrown out (no, they’re not recyclable). Plastic is also made from oil, so recycling it is a climate win-win. And we could soon make great strides here, thanks to our next Survivor: the plastic-munching mutant enzyme.</p><p class="_1HzXw">It was made <a class="_2f8qj FQVx7 _2tPjN _1QHxY" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/16/scientists-accidentally-create-mutant-enzyme-that-eats-plastic-bottles" data-component="ContentLink">by accident</a> by Japanese researchers (classic mistake, we’ve all been there).

It’s not just plants that can soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - as we explored in the life-changing-magic-of-dung-beetles, healthy soil can too. Then there’s what’s known as “blue carbon”, stored by algae, seaweed and other marine ecosystems.</p><p class="_1HzXw">The earth’s carbon sinks soak up around half of the carbon dioxide that humans emit, and with some help, that number could be a lot higher.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Basically, we need more trees, more algae, more seaweed.</p><p class="_1HzXw">It sounds simple, but there’s a catch - if those trees burn down, which they’ll increasingly do, all the carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere. This is exactly what happened with the Black Summer bushfires, which <a class="_2f8qj FQVx7 _2tPjN _1QHxY" href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/21/summers-bushfires-released-more-carbon-dioxide-than-australia-does-in-a-year#:~:text=Summer&#x27;s%20bushfires%20released%20more%20carbon%20dioxide%20than%20Australia%20does%20in%20a%20year,-This%20article%20is&amp;text=Australia&#x27;s%20devastating%20bushfire%20season%20is,according%20to%20a%20government%20estimate." data-component="ContentLink">emitted more carbon dioxide</a> than pretty much any country in the world does annually, besides the five biggest polluters.</p><p class="_1HzXw">And what’s worse, Australia has put most of its eggs in the “trees” basket when it comes to reducing emissions.</p><p class="_1HzXw">As a fossil fuel nation, not chopping down a few forests is cheaper than, say, shuttering the mining industry. So when the Kyoto Protocol was being negotiated, we fought for the “Australia clause”, which allowed us to count protecting forests towards our carbon targets.</p><p class="_1HzXw">While that’s been good news for our forests, we never had to invest heavily in transitioning all our other sectors - making it more expensive and ambitious now.</p><p class="_1HzXw">And as a global player, we’re claiming carbon credits for a whole lot of forest that’s since burnt down - which is one of the reasons the world is kinda pissed with Australia. </p><p class="_1HzXw"><em>But wait, why can’t we just plant MORE trees to insure against the ones that burn down?</em></p><p class="_1HzXw">It takes years for trees to grow to the size where they’re soaking up the amount of carbon required, and in the meantime, that carbon is sitting around rapidly heating the planet. </p><p class="_1HzXw">You can’t go on planting new trees forever as we have a finite amount of space: ultimately you have to stop pumping out pollution. But trees, algae and seaweed can buy us time. If, say, our emissions reduce to 20% of what they were, if we can soak up that same amount of Co2, then we are at “net zero”.</p><p class="_1HzXw"><em>So, how do we do it?</em></p><p class="_1HzXw">Planting trees and protecting forests - you know the drill there (but did you know drones can plant trees from the sky? Or that paying landowners to protect trees already helped some farmers through the drought?)</p><p class="_1HzXw">But how do we protect our carbon forests from bushfire?</p><p class="_1HzXw">We plant things underwater.</p><p class="_1HzXw">And what’s more, coastal ecosystems are actually way better at absorbing Co2 than land forests.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Once again, we are the lucky country, with 25,000km of coastline - that’s more than the distance from the South Pole to the equator.</p><p class="_1HzXw">And this is key for our next Climate Survivor fighter: seaweed.</p><p class="_1HzXw">When it’s not otherwise occupied holding your sushi together and making postcard-perfect beaches smell like rotten eggs, seaweed could save the world.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Here’s how it works: the seaweed soaks up colossal amounts of Co2, we burn it in lieu of natural gas for electricity, and capture and store those emissions. Seaweed would become a biofuel, like the E10 petrol you put in your car, which is currently made from soybeans or corn, which often drive deforestation.</p><p class="_1HzXw">By covering 9 per cent of the ocean in seaweed farms, we could replace the whole world’s fossil fuel usage, while removing twice as much carbon dioxide from the air as we currently emit globally. We’d enter “negative emissions”, beginning to remove the carbon dioxide that’s been sitting around since the industrial revolution and actually cooling the planet.</p><p class="_1HzXw">You’ve probably heard about how climate change will turn the ocean into a giant pool of acid. By soaking up C02, seaweed can reverse that, so your summers may not involve swimming in battery fluid amongst coral ghost-towns after all.</p><p class="_1HzXw">But it gets even better than undoing all our pollution ever like a giant eraser and pretending we never almost-destroyed-life-on-Earth. </p><p class="_1HzXw">Seaweed also cleans the ocean like a pool filter and increases marine life. It’s an all-rounder, which is why it’s been called a “charismatic carbon” or the “swiss-army knife of the sea”. </p><p class="_1HzXw">Covering 9 per cent of the ocean in seaweed would sustainably provide 200kgs of fish per person each year for 10 billion people.</p><p class="_1HzXw">That’s like three servings of fish a day, every day, for the rest of your life - and while you (hopefully) haven’t lived off canned tuna since uni, remember that fish is the staple food for one billion people, who are gonna really struggle to eat when seafood runs out in 2048. </p><p class="_1HzXw">Now, converting 9 per cent of the ocean into seaweed farms is a tall order, but we could do a lot with a little. Farming seaweed in just 0.0X% of California’s waters would cancel out the emissions from the state’s agriculture industry. And there’s already seaweed farms setting up shop in Australia, like the proposal to turn Moreton Bay into a seaweed haven.</p><p class="_1HzXw">So, splash some cash on seaweed stocks - it’s the next bitcoin, without the crash - and yes, we want a finder’s fee.</p><div id="inputbigseaweed" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><p class="_1HzXw">So there we have it - a simple path to a carbon free Australia.

Our creations have changed the world, from the refrigerator to ultrasounds, the electric drill, antibiotics, cochlear implants, plastic money, pacemakers, permaculture, powerboards, feature films, surf skis, military tanks, zinc cream, baby seats, multifocal contact lenses, Google Maps, Wifi, black-box flight recorders and those inflatable slides that come out during emergency landings, spray-on skin and the clapperboard used on shoots when they shout “LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION”. </p><p class="_1HzXw">We’ve also invented many of the tools for combating climate change, like wave energy, solar tiles, heat-reflective paint, Ultrabatteries for clean cars, not to mention all the developments to solar cells that have helped them take off globally. Aussie researchers even just invented an alternative to batteries that store renewable energy for longer: stackable blocks that could replace coal in a coal-fired power station. </p><p class="_1HzXw">The question for Australia is, do we want to be a mosquito or a dung beetle? A spreader of destruction for poorer countries, or a humble powerhouse working underground to support the big players up top to keep our planet liveable? </p><p class="_1HzXw">Remember, the dung beetle might be small but it can pull the equivalent of six double-decker buses. The choice is ours.</p><div id="inputmosquito" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><h3 class="_3mduI _2t6_4 _1deB8 jwLlj _19NQB _1GKnS _2o9MN _1-RZJ" data-component="Heading">So what do
