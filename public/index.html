More Elon Musks are lining up to throw billions at Australian renewables, but there are a few key blockers. The first is that we have no national energy policy to give them certainty. And that matters because the government controls things like the grid - which needs major upgrades to make it renewables-friendly.</p><p class="_1HzXw">What’s more, our Renewable Energy Target was reached in 2019 and there’s no plan to increase it. That target forced power companies to source around 23% of electricity from renewables, which cost the government nothing but created a market for renewable projects. Already, investment in large-scale renewables has halved and 11,000 renewables jobs could be lost by 2022 unless the target is updated - that’s equivalent to losing all the workers who produce coal for domestic use... not what you want in a recession.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Instead, the Morrison Government wants to spend taxpayer dollars propping up the gas industry which is bleeding so much money it can’t find investors itself.

This is the closest cars have come to saving the world since Transformers.</p><p class="_1HzXw">The AEMC and the South Australian Liberal government reckon this approach could be a game-changer for power prices. We “gold plate” poles and wires to manage the few hours a day when everyone wants to use power at the same time. But if you can run your dishwasher with power your car bought earlier, that reduces “peak demand”, so power companies can spend less on that turbo infrastructure and pass the savings on.</p><div id="inputcarscansaveus" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><p class="_1HzXw"><em>I hear what you’re saying but I just can’t see myself driving an electric car.</em></p><p class="_1HzXw">If you’re still hung up on the idea of refilling at a bowser and not a power point, don’t despair - you might like a hydrogen car. At the moment there are very few hydrogen vehicles in production, but that&#x27;s about to change, driven by countries like Japan who don’t have the renewables to service EVs. On our own soil, a startup called H2X hopes to begin producing hydrogen cars from Port Kembla near Wollongong in 2022.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Our abundant supplies of hydrogen (more on that later) could bring Aussie car-making back from the grave, making it more than a faint memory for your uncle who still mutters “Ford… Holden…” in his sleep.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Hydrogen will be key for trucks and other long-haul transport, where recharging every 200km is a drag.</p><p class="_1HzXw">There’s also biofuels, which are made by burning organic waste, which is a win-win. Right now, we are missing out on thousands of regional jobs by overlooking bioenergy, according to KPMG. It’s a huge part of Europe’s energy mix - used for heating, cooling, fuels and chemicals.</p><p class="_1HzXw">The fuels of the future are imminent. But really, we don’t need trucks travelling distances so epic that drivers must abuse amphetamines to get their paycheck. We need high-speed rail, powered by renewable energy - like Deutsche Bahn, the fabled German network and trainspotters’ wet dream, which is already 57% renewable and will be fully renewable by 2038. High-speed rail would knock out up to 80% of plane trips along the corridors it serves too.</p><p class="_1HzXw">And without spending a dollar, we could do so much more today. We’re one of the worst countries in the OECD at regulating vehicle emissions - which is like giving car-makers a free pass to pollute. Instead, we could follow New Zealand and tax new high-polluting cars to subsidise cleaner cars. Or we could use congestion charging, like London, where it costs more to travel at peak hour, helping to spread out commuting and ease pollution.</p><p class="_1HzXw">We could also let office-workers choose to keep working from home, and never have to wear pants again.</p><div id="endparagraphtext" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><div id="panel" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><div id="inputfossiltransport" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><div id="endpanel" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><div id="panel" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><h3 class="_3mduI _2t6_4 _1deB8 jwLlj _19NQB _1GKnS _2o9MN _1-RZJ" data-component="Heading">Challenge four: Wean our industries off carbon (40% emissions)</h3><div id="visualKEY14" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><div id="endpanel" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><div id="paragraphtext" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><p class="_1HzXw">Let’s start with the good news. Switching to clean energy and fuels (which we already solved) would knock out up to 60 per cent of emissions across most sectors of the economy.</p><p class="_1HzXw">The first step is to electrify everything that runs on gas. But while the Australian Industry Group is <a class="_2f8qj FQVx7 _2tPjN _1QHxY" href="https://cdn.aigroup.com.au/Submissions/Budget/2020/Budget_submission_2020-21.pdf" data-component="ContentLink">calling for subsidies</a> to do just that, ScoMo’s Covid-19 commission, stacked with gas executives, wants to ramp up gas production. </p><p class="_1HzXw">This means taxpayers will foot the bill for a whole lot of gas that no-one wants to buy, or factories will put off electrification and emissions will continue to climb.</p><p class="_1HzXw">While we’re not on track, electrifying everything is relatively simple. What’s harder is tackling “non-energy emissions”, like fugitive emissions. While that sounds very Harry Houdini, it’s basically the gases that escape when you’re pulling fossil fuels out of the ground and shipping them around the world. It’s hard to completely contain an invisible gas, although some nifty solutions are being developed, like a <a class="_2f8qj FQVx7 _2tPjN _1QHxY" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/climate/methane-monitoring-satellite.html" data-component="ContentLink">satellite</a> that can spot leaking gas wells from space.</p><p class="_1HzXw">But here’s the thing: as the world moves to net zero, fossil fuels will make up less of our export mix. And that’s not the catastrophe you might be expecting: for example, while we’re the world’s biggest gas exporter, most of the profits go offshore anyway, most of the companies pay no tax here and the industry employs fewer Australians than just about any other per dollar of investment.</p><p class="_1HzXw">The reality is, most Australians don’t wear a hard hat to work - service industries make up 70 per cent of our GDP, employing four out of five Australians. </p><p class="_1HzXw">Still, we can’t afford to lose any jobs in regional Australia, which is why we need to get our skates on when it comes to replacing fossil fuels exports. </p><p class="_1HzXw">Fortunately, there’s a bunch of opportunities here. Aside from sending renewable energy to Asia through epic submarine cables, we can use it to create zero-emissions products and fuels, which will be in high demand as the world moves to net zero.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Already, the EU is proposing a tax on carbon-intensive products - that’s the world’s largest market, so it’s likely to force companies to work out how to reduce emissions throughout their supply chains.</p><p class="_1HzXw">With our abundant renewable energy, we are well placed to be the world’s factory for zero-emissions products. If you thought “Made in Australia” died with Dick Smith’s Y2K-era Ozemite, think again.</p><div id="endparagraphtext" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><div id="panel" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><p class="_1HzXw">So what are we selling exactly? Well, a few things, but let’s start with our next character in the Climate Survivor cast: green hydrogen.</p><div id="visualKEY15" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><div id="endpanel" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><div id="panel" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><p class="_1HzXw">Hydrogen - the element most famous for its role as H2 in H20 - will be the oil and gas of the 21st century.</p><div id="endpanel" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><div id="paragraphtext" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><p class="_1HzXw">You can make fuel from it (remember hydrogen cars?), you can power things, heat things - you name it, hydrogen can do it.</p><p class="_1HzXw">“Grey” hydrogen is made with fossil fuels, but “green” hydrogen is made from wind and solar energy instead, making it a zero emissions fuel.</p><p class="_1HzXw">The more clean energy you have, the more cheaply you can produce green hydrogen, so Chief Scientist Alan Finkel is figuring out how we become a hydrogen superpower.</p><p class="_1HzXw">It’s possible that we won’t be able to compete with other renewable-rich countries after shipping because we’re an island at the end of the Earth. But it’s ok - we can still use our green hydrogen to make zero-emissions chemicals and metals like steel, aluminium, iron ore and ammonia. </p><p class="_1HzXw">The <a class="_2f8qj FQVx7 _2tPjN _1QHxY" href="https://grattan.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2020-06-Start-with-steel.pdf" data-component="ContentLink">largest and most economically viable</a> opportunity is green steel-making, according to the Grattan Institute. Coal-based steel is responsible for 6-7 per cent of global emissions, but swapping for green steel could sustainably build the developing world while growing our steel industry in places like Whyalla, Newcastle and XX.</p><p class="_1HzXw">We could also export biofuels, which would grow our agricultural sector and pump money into the regions.<br/>And let’s not forget, shipping things to other countries isn’t the only way to get rich. Education and tourism are some of our top exports, and have ironically been held back over the years by the high Aussie dollar that resulted from the mining boom. </p><p class="_1HzXw">Technology, the arts and the night-time economy are all sectors we could grow (once going to a bar involves more dancing, fewer QR codes).</p><p class="_1HzXw"><em>Ok so what about materials that just can’t be greened?</em></p><p class="_1HzXw">We’ll need to swap for greener alternatives, or recycle existing materials.</p><p class="_1HzXw">An example of swapping is constructing high-rise buildings from timber. While that might sound very kum-ba-yah, the notorious hippies at Lendlease just opened the world’s tallest timber office building in Brisbane, <a class="_2f8qj FQVx7 _2tPjN _1QHxY" href="https://www.lendlease.com/au/media-centre/media-releases/20181122-lendlease-unveils-australias-tallest-timber/" data-component="ContentLink">25 King</a>. (Can jet fuel melt timber beams? Hopefully we won’t find out).</p><p class="_1HzXw">Often, the substitutes are actually better - for example, geopolymer cement is a greener type of concrete that’s twice as fire resistant. You can check it out for yourself at Brisbane Airport (just kidding, you’re not coming anywhere near Fortress Queensland).</p><p class="_1HzXw">Where we can’t swap, we’ll reuse existing materials over and over to create a “circular economy”. </p><p class="_1HzXw">For example, some Melbourne councils are turning printer cartridges into asphalt (and if you still own a printer, you’ll know refilling it is like feeding a tamagotchi - endless, thankless and <a class="_2f8qj FQVx7 _2tPjN _1QHxY" href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/feb/23/printer-ink-cartridges-paying-more-getting-less" data-component="ContentLink">essentially a con</a>.) Once again, the printer-cartridge superhighway actually outperforms a regular road. It’s better able to handle trucks, with a “65 per cent improvement in fatigue life” (yes, even roads feel tired all the time for no reason).</p><p class="_1HzXw">Printer cartridges would otherwise be sitting in landfill until the year 2500, along with every coffee cup you’ve ever thrown out (no, they’re not recyclable). Plastic is also made from oil, so recycling it is a climate win-win. And we could soon make great strides here, thanks to our next Survivor: the plastic-munching mutant enzyme.</p><p class="_1HzXw">It was made <a class="_2f8qj FQVx7 _2tPjN _1QHxY" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/16/scientists-accidentally-create-mutant-enzyme-that-eats-plastic-bottles" data-component="ContentLink">by accident</a> by Japanese researchers (classic mistake, we’ve all been there).

It’s not just plants that can soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - as we explored in the life-changing-magic-of-dung-beetles, healthy soil can too. Then there’s what’s known as “blue carbon”, stored by algae, seaweed and other marine ecosystems.</p><p class="_1HzXw">The earth’s carbon sinks soak up around half of the carbon dioxide that humans emit, and with some help, that number could be a lot higher.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Basically, we need more trees, more algae, more seaweed.</p><div id="visualKEY17" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><p class="_1HzXw">It sounds simple, but there’s a catch - if those trees burn down, which they’ll increasingly do, all the carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere. This is exactly what happened with the Black Summer bushfires, which <a class="_2f8qj FQVx7 _2tPjN _1QHxY" href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/21/summers-bushfires-released-more-carbon-dioxide-than-australia-does-in-a-year#:~:text=Summer&#x27;s%20bushfires%20released%20more%20carbon%20dioxide%20than%20Australia%20does%20in%20a%20year,-This%20article%20is&amp;text=Australia&#x27;s%20devastating%20bushfire%20season%20is,according%20to%20a%20government%20estimate." data-component="ContentLink">emitted more carbon dioxide</a> than pretty much any country in the world does annually, besides the five biggest polluters.</p><p class="_1HzXw">And what’s worse, Australia has put most of its eggs in the “trees” basket when it comes to reducing emissions.</p><p class="_1HzXw">As a fossil fuel nation, not chopping down a few forests is cheaper than, say, shuttering the mining industry. So when the Kyoto Protocol was being negotiated, we fought for the “Australia clause”, which allowed us to count protecting forests towards our carbon targets.</p><p class="_1HzXw">While that’s been good news for our forests, we never had to invest heavily in transitioning all our other sectors - making it more expensive and ambitious now.</p><p class="_1HzXw">And as a global player, we’re claiming carbon credits for a whole lot of forest that’s since burnt down - which is one of the reasons the world is kinda pissed with Australia. </p><p class="_1HzXw"><em>But wait, why can’t we just plant MORE trees to insure against the ones that burn down?</em></p><p class="_1HzXw">It takes years for trees to grow to the size where they’re soaking up the amount of carbon required, and in the meantime, that carbon is sitting around rapidly heating the planet. </p><p class="_1HzXw">You can’t go on planting new trees forever as we have a finite amount of space: ultimately you have to stop pumping out pollution. But trees, algae and seaweed can buy us time. If, say, our emissions reduce to 20% of what they were, if we can soak up that same amount of Co2, then we are at “net zero”.</p><div id="endparagraphtext" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><div id="panel" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><p class="_1HzXw"><em>So, how do we do it?</em></p><div id="visualKEY18" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><p class="_1HzXw">Planting trees and protecting forests - you know the drill there (but did you know drones can plant trees from the sky? Or that paying landowners to protect trees already helped some farmers through the drought?)</p><p class="_1HzXw">But how do we protect our carbon forests from bushfire?</p><div id="endpanel" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><div id="panel" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><p class="_1HzXw">We plant things underwater.</p><div id="endpanel" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><div id="paragraphtext" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><p class="_1HzXw">And what’s more, coastal ecosystems are actually way better at absorbing Co2 than land forests.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Once again, we are the lucky country, with 25,000km of coastline - that’s more than the distance from the South Pole to the equator.</p><p class="_1HzXw">And this is key for our next Climate Survivor fighter: seaweed.</p><p class="_1HzXw">When it’s not otherwise occupied holding your sushi together and making postcard-perfect beaches smell like rotten eggs, seaweed could save the world.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Here’s how it works: the seaweed soaks up colossal amounts of Co2, we burn it in lieu of natural gas for electricity, and capture and store those emissions. Seaweed would become a biofuel, like the E10 petrol you put in your car, which is currently made from soybeans or corn, which often drive deforestation.</p><p class="_1HzXw">By covering 9 per cent of the ocean in seaweed farms, we could replace the whole world’s fossil fuel usage, while removing twice as much carbon dioxide from the air as we currently emit globally. We’d enter “negative emissions”, beginning to remove the carbon dioxide that’s been sitting around since the industrial revolution and actually cooling the planet.</p><p class="_1HzXw">You’ve probably heard about how climate change will turn the ocean into a giant pool of acid. By soaking up C02, seaweed can reverse that, so your summers may not involve swimming in battery fluid amongst coral ghost-towns after all.</p><p class="_1HzXw">But it gets even better than undoing all our pollution ever like a giant eraser and pretending we never almost-destroyed-life-on-Earth. </p><p class="_1HzXw">Seaweed also cleans the ocean like a pool filter and increases marine life. It’s an all-rounder, which is why it’s been called a “charismatic carbon” or the “swiss-army knife of the sea”. </p><p class="_1HzXw">Covering 9 per cent of the ocean in seaweed would sustainably provide 200kgs of fish per person each year for 10 billion people.</p><p class="_1HzXw">That’s like three servings of fish a day, every day, for the rest of your life - and while you (hopefully) haven’t lived off canned tuna since uni, remember that fish is the staple food for one billion people, who are gonna really struggle to eat when seafood runs out in 2048. </p><p class="_1HzXw">Now, converting 9 per cent of the ocean into seaweed farms is a tall order, but we could do a lot with a little. Farming seaweed in just 0.0X% of California’s waters would cancel out the emissions from the state’s agriculture industry. And there’s already seaweed farms setting up shop in Australia, like the proposal to turn Moreton Bay into a seaweed haven.</p><div id="endparagraphtext" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><div id="panel" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><p class="_1HzXw">So, splash some cash on seaweed stocks - it’s the next bitcoin, without the crash - and yes, we want a finder’s fee.</p><div id="inputbigseaweed" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><div id="endpanel" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><div id="panel" data-component="Anchor" data-mount="true"></div><p class="_1HzXw">So there we have it - a simple path to a carbon free Australia.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#x27;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p><p class="_1HzXw">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &quot;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&quot; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
